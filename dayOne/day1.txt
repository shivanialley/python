Operators

	Example:
		print(10+5)
	
	Python divides the operators in the following groups:
	1. Arithmetic Operators
	2. Logical
	3. Bitwise
	4. Assignment
	5. Identity
	6. Comparison
	7. Membership

	Operator			Name 					Example
	+ 				Addition				x+y
	-				Subtraction				x-y
	*				Multiplication				x*y
	/				Division				x/y
	%				Modulus					x%y
	**				Exponentiation				x**y
	//		Floor division(round off in upper or lower limit)	x//y
	
Concatination cant do in string

	Assignment Operators
	=
	+=
	-=
	*=
	/=
	%=
	//=
	**=
	
	Comparison Operators
	==
	!=
	>
	<
	>=
	<=

	Logical Operators
	and
	or
	not

	Identity Operators
	is -> Returns True if both variable are the same object
	is not -> 

	Membersip Operators
	in ->
	not in

	User Input
	raw_input() method in pyhton2.7
	input() method in python3.6
		Example
			username = input("Enter username")
			print("Username is:" +username)

	Flow of Control
	
	What is Module
		Consider a module to be the same as a code library
		A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application

	We can include one line from library
	any file is use as a module
	in myfile.py
		def message(name);
			print("Hello," +name)

	inport myfie
	myfile.message("All")

	Another example
		File myfile.py
			person1 = {	#dictionary
				"name" : "Shivani",
				"age" : 25,
				"country" : "India"
				}

		import myfile
		a = myfile.person1["age"]
		print(a)

	Alias
		import myfile as mf #mf is short name of file name
		a = mf.person1["age"]
		print(a)


	Build-in Modules
		import platform
		x = platform.system()
		print(x)

	def msg(name)  #function
		print("Hello," +name)
	
	person1 = {
		"name" : "SHivani"
		"age" : 25
		}
	

	from myfile import person1
	print(person1["age"])
	
		
	1. Write a program to display 3 line message
	2. Write a program to take input from user
		student number, name, branch & university print the details print the details
	3. Create a module consisting of 2 function area of rectangle & area of square from the main program do the following 	
		1st program calclate the area of square only
		2nd program calculate area of rectangle only
		3rd program calculate area of both
	

	If-else

		Example
		a=20
		b=30
		if b>a:
			print("b is greater than a")
		elif a ==b:
			print("a and b is equal")
		else: 
			print(a is greater than b")

	One line if statement
	if a>b:print("a is greater than b")
		
	One line if else statement
	a=20
	b=100
	print("A") if a>b else print("B")


	a=100
	b=100
	print("a") if(a>b) else print("=") if a==b else print("b")

	practise in single line for program
	
	And 
		if a>b and b>c:

	Or
		if a>b or b>c:

	Not
		if not a>b:
		
	Nested If:
		if:
		if:
		else:

	Pass statement
		if b>a:
			pass #pass to stop avoid error
		
	new question for if else
