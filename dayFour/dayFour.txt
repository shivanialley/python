Pandas:
    csv format->comma separated format
    excel ->distributed format
    
    panda series
    DataFrames:
        Data sets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames.
        Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table
        
        
        drop_ns() method
        
        Remove row
            df.dropna(subset=["Date"],inplace=True)
            
          Ques1 Create a datasets in CSV format consisting of the following data:
              product_id,product_name,category, price,quantity
              Do the following:-
                  a. Load the csv file into the pandas DataFrames
                  b. Check for and handle any missing values or inconsistancy in datasets  (data cleaning)
                  c. Calculate sum of quantity, average of price, total cells & top selling product
                     [use the following methods: sum and mean]
                     
          Ques2 Create a vehicle class with attributes no of wheels no of airbags,Max speed etc
              Create a constructor & a method that displays vehicle's info
              
        [important] Ques3 Create a child class bus from vehicle class that inherit all of the variables & methods from vehicles class
              the bus class have its own attributes number at doors, fair per kilometer, number of seats, along with inherited attributes
          Write a method to calculate bus fair by accepting distance in kilometer as parameter
          
          numpy
              create array & play with array
              2D array consist of [[],[]]
              split,
              reshape
              search
              sort
              
             important note- number have shape
                 image to array
                 array to image using numpy
