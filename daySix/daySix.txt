        Ques1   Create a numpy array x containing data representing time(in hrs) spend on studing : [1,2,3,4,5]
                Create a  numpy array y containing corresponding data representing study score(out of 100) : [50,60,70,80,90]
                Plot a line graph with blue solid line
                Overlay (on top of it) a scatter plot with red markers
            
        Ques2 Create a numpy array categories representing different subject : ["math","science","history","english","arts"]
              Create a numpy array scores with average score(out of 100) for each subject :[85,70,75,90,80]
              Plot a bar graph representing subject & its score
              Colour each bar differently
              Add label, title & modify grid line to display a dash style
