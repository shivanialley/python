Looping in Python
    For Loops
        1. for loop is used for iterating over a squence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set or a string)
        2. this is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an interator method as found 
        Example
            fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]#list 
            for x in fruits:
                print(x)
                
            for x in "banana"
                print(x)
                
     Break
         With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
         Example
             fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]#list 
            for x in fruits:
                print(x)
                if x=="banana"
                    break
                    
                    
      Continue
          fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]#list 
            for x in fruits:
                if x=="banana":
                continue
                print(x)
                        
      Range
      
      Else in for loop
      
      Nested Loop
      
      pass keyword
      
      while loop
          i=1
          while i<6:
              print(i)
              i+=1
              
      Strings
          "hello'
          'hi'
          
      Multiline string
      str="""good morning,
      hi,
      hello"""
      print(str)
      
      str='''good morning,
      hi,
      hello'''
      print(str)
      
      strings are array
             a="hello,World!"
             print(a[1])
             
       string length
           to get the length of a string, use the len() function
            a="hello,World"
            print(len(a))
            
       Check string
           txt="today is a good day"
           print("good" in txt)#get output is true or false
           
      Check if NOT
          To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string we can use the keyword not in
          
          
      Slicing
          You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax
          b="Hello,World"
          print(b[2:5])
          
     Basic Operations
         upper()
         lower()
         strip()
         replace()
         split()
         
     String Concatenation
     
     String Format
         format() to insert numbers in string
         
      Escape Character
      \" \"
        
          
       \' Single Quote
       \\ Backslash
       \n New Line
       \r Carriage Return
       \t tab
       \b Backspace
       
       Method in string
       capitalize()
       casefold()
       center()
       count()
       encode()
       replace()
       rfind()
       rindex()
       rjust()
       rpartition()
       rsplit()
       
       All string method return not modify the string
       
       Tuples
           mytuple=("car","bus","truck")
           
           1. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable
           2. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable
           3. Tuples are written with round brackets
           4. Tuple items are ordered, unchangable and allow duplicate values
           5. Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index[0], the second items has index[1] etc
           6. Tuples are unchangable meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has created
           7. Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value
           
           
          Tuple Length
          
          print(len(mytiple))
          
          Create Tuple with one item
              To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item
          mytuple=("car",)
          print(type(mytuple))
          
          #not tuple
          mytuple=("car")
          print(type(mytuple))
 
     tuple can contain different data types
     
     typle()method to make tuple
     mytuple=tuple(("car","bus","truck"))
     
     Access Tuple Items
     print(mytuple[1])
     print(mytuple[-1])
     
     Ranges of Indexes
         You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range
         
     Check if item Exits
     
     Tuples are inmutable & unchangable
     list is modifiable

     Unpacking a tuple
     
     Using asterisk
     If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable

     Dictionaries
         changable & not allow duplicates
         Dictionaries are used to store data valuews in key: value pairs.
    
        Dictionary Items
        Dictionary items are ordered, changable and donot allow duplicates
       
       Dictionary duplicate
       Dictionary length
